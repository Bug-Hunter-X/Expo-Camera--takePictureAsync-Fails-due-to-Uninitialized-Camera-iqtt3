# Expo Camera Initialization Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the Expo Camera API: calling `takePictureAsync` before the camera has finished initializing.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

The problem stems from the asynchronous nature of the Camera component.  It needs time to load and prepare before taking pictures.  Attempting to take a picture prematurely results in errors, often related to the camera not being ready.

The solution involves using the `isCameraReady` method (or equivalent) to check the camera's readiness before initiating the picture capture process.  This ensures that the `takePictureAsync` call is only made after the camera is fully functional.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the Expo development server.
4. Observe the error in `bug.js` and the solution in `bugSolution.js`.
